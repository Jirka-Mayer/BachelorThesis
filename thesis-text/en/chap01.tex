\chapter{Deep Neural Network}
\label{chap:DeepNeuralNetwork}

This chapter talks mainly about the model we decided to use. First we describe the full pipeline of a traditional OMR system. Many of these steps are shared between traditional and deep learning approaches. Then we will talk about the deep learning approaches that can be taken. Neural networks can replace parts of a traditional pipeline, or they can be used in an end-to-end setting, where the neural network replaces the most difficult core of the pipeline. We will describe our architecture consisting of a convolutional block, recurrent block and the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss function. Following sections describe in more detail what a neural network is and how the individual blocks of our model work internally. The last section explains how CTC works and what are its pros and cons, compared to the approach described in the HMR baseline article (\cite{HmrBaseline}).

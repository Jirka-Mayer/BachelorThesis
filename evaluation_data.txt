Results gathered from several runs
==================================

There are experiments 01, 02, 03 and 04

Each experiment was run first with seed 20200524 + 0,
this first run was on 63_000 items.

Additional runs were performed with seed 20200524 + k     (k > 0)
that ran on full 63_127 items.

The results:

             IN DOMAIN
----------------------------------
Ex. | k: |  000  |  001  |  002  |
---------| ----- | ----- | ----- |
01       | 0.337 | 0.345 |   ?   |
02       | 0.284 | 0.290 |   ?   |
03       | 0.260 | 0.239 |   ?   |
04       | 0.251 | 0.266 |   ?   |

           OUT OF DOMAIN
----------------------------------
Ex. | k: |  000  |  001  |  002  |
---------| ----- | ----- | ----- |
01       | 0.593 | 0.605 |   ?   |
02       | 0.605 | 0.578 |   ?   |
03       | 0.469 | 0.499 |   ?   |
04       | 0.510 | 0.500 |   ?   |

NOTES:
experiment_03_001 ... crashed in ~30%, right in the optimum
experiment_04_001 ... crashed in ~65%, well past the optimum
Both will be re-run with k=002, hopefully not crashing this time
to get the full chart for the article.

ALSO:
All values are first normalized over each staff and then averaged
over all staves in the dataset.
We could maybe directly normalize over the entire dataset.
